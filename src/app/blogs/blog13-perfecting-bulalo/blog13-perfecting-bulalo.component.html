      <h3>Ingredients for Simmering:</h3><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Beef shanks</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, quartered, not diced</li>
        <li>Black peppercorns - put whole and grounded</li>
        <li>Beef broth - optional for more flavor and color</li>

      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3>Optional Ingredients:</h3><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Saba banana - if you don't have this type of banana, do not put the regular bananas because they are too

      </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Process:</h2><br>
    <h3>Suds Management:</h3><br>
    <p>
      In the initial stages of simmering beef shanks and bone marrow, the appearance of foam, or 'suds,' is inevitable.
      Utilizing a ladle to remove these impurities is imperative. This meticulous step ensures a clear, unclouded broth,
      allowing the robust flavors to shine through without distraction.</p><br>
    <h3>

      Precision in Meat Tenderness:</h3><br>
    <p>
      Achieving the optimal tenderness of the meat is a delicate balance. Vigilance during the simmering process is key.
      Once the beef shanks and bone marrow attain the desired tenderness, prompt removal is necessary to prevent
      overcooking. The aim is to preserve a succulent texture that complements the overall composition of the dish.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Strategic Pot Transition for Perfect Bulalo:</h3><br>
    <p>
      To ensure the vegetables retain their freshness and vibrant crunch, a strategic pot transition becomes pivotal in
      perfecting Bulalo. Given the substantial quantity of meat and bones involved, shifting from a larger to a smaller
      pot is not just a suggestion but a culinary necessity. This method prevents unintended overcooking and, equally
      important, avoids mixing the vegetables with the meat that will be enjoyed in the future. By transferring a
      portion of the meat to the smaller pot, the cook maintains a harmonious balance, allowing each component to reach
      its pinnacle of flavor without compromise. Placing the vegetables in the smaller pot not only safeguards them from
      overcooking but also prevents potential spoilage, ensuring that the Bulalo remains a delight to the senses. The
      introduction of vegetables, such as napa cabbage and snap beans, marks the final phase of Bulalo preparation.
      Optimal timing is crucial, with a brief, focused cooking period of approximately five minutes, delivering a dish
      where each element shines without succumbing to overcooking or premature spoilage.</p><br>

    <p>

      Crafting a sublime Bulalo necessitates attention to detail and an understanding of the interplay between
      ingredients. By skillfully managing suds, preserving meat tenderness, executing strategic pot transitions, and
      mastering the art of vegetable addition, one can elevate this Filipino classic to a culinary triumph. The result
      is not merely a soup; it is a symphony of flavors that resonates with the discerning palate. Embrace the process,
      and relish the rewards of a well-executed Bulalo, where simplicity meets culinary excellence.
