    <p>BOCA CHICA, Texas/NEW YORK, Nov 18 - SpaceX's uncrewed spacecraft Starship, designed for lunar and interplanetary
      missions, experienced a setback during its second test flight, cutting short its mission but surpassing the
      outcome of a previous attempt that ended in an explosion.</p><br>
    <p>

      The two-stage rocketship lifted off from SpaceX's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica in Texas, reaching an
      altitude of 90 miles (148 km) on a planned 90-minute test mission. However, the Super Heavy first stage booster
      exploded over the Gulf of Mexico after detaching, while the core Starship stage continued its ascent before losing
      contact with mission control.</p><br>

      "We have lost the data from the second stage... we think we may have lost the second stage," said SpaceX engineer
      John Insprucker, indicating that an automated flight termination command might have triggered the rocket's
      destruction. About eight minutes into the test, an explosion was observed, suggesting a failure of the Starship
      booster at an altitude of 91 miles (148 km).The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration confirmed a mishap resulting
      in a "loss of the vehicle" but reported no
      injuries or property damage. The FAA will lead an investigation into the failure and review SpaceX's prevention
      plan.</p><br>

      The mission aimed to launch Starship into space, descend through Earth's atmosphere, and splash down off Hawaii's
      coast. Testing failures may pose challenges for SpaceX, requiring regulatory reviews, but align with the company's
      risk-tolerant culture.
      Despite setbacks, successes were noted in the test, and SpaceX stated on social media platform X that "success
      comes from what we learn." The core Starship stage's engines fired for several minutes on its way to space.</p>

      A fully successful test is crucial for SpaceX's ambition to use Starship for lunar missions under NASA's Artemis
      program and, ultimately, for Mars exploration. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder, envisions Starship replacing the
      Falcon 9 rocket as the company's primary launch vehicle.</p><br>
    <p>

      The clock is ticking for SpaceX to deliver on its timeline, especially as NASA relies on Starship for future
      crewed moon landings. Saturday's test is viewed as an opportunity to learn and iterate for future flights. SpaceX
      investors anticipate a swift resumption of tests pending FAA reviews and technical evaluations.

      The challenge underscores the complexities of rapid spacecraft development, emphasizing the need for a balance
      between speed and thorough testing in the pursuit of space exploration goals.
