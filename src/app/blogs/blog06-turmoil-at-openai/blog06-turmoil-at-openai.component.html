    <p>
      San Francisco, Nov 20 - In a surprising turn of events, OpenAI, the trailblazing organization at the
      forefront of the artificial intelligence boom, has named ex-Twitch boss Emmett Shear as interim CEO. Outgoing
      chief Sam Altman, in an unexpected move, transitioned to supporter Microsoft (MSFT.O), leaving the startup in a
      state of uncertainty.</p><br>
    <p>

      The recent appointments, finalized late on Sunday, followed Altman's sudden removal as CEO of the ChatGPT maker,
      dispelling any speculation about his potential return. However, by Monday, almost all of OpenAI's 700-plus
      employees expressed their discontent, demanding the resignation of the board and the reinstatement of Altman and
      former President Greg Brockman.</p><br>
    <p>

      OpenAI's chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who was involved in Altman's firing, expressed regret for his
      participation in the board's actions and pledged to work towards reuniting the company.</p><br>
    <p>

      Amidst the upheaval, Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reassured stakeholders about OpenAI's future. Altman,
      in a post on social media platform X, stated that his top priority is to ensure OpenAI continues to thrive, and
      Nadella, during a CNBC interview, expressed openness to retaining OpenAI staff within Microsoft.</p><br>
    <p>

      Microsoft moved swiftly to attract key talent that left OpenAI, including co-founder Brockman, aiming to stabilize
      the startup in which it invested billions. The tech giant's involvement raises questions about the governance of
      the ChatGPT maker.</p><br>
    <p>

      OpenAI's interim head, Shear, dismissed rumors of Altman's removal being related to a dispute over the safety of
      powerful AI models. He pledged to investigate the firing, consider new governance structures, and continue the
      path of making technology, such as the viral chatbot, available.</p><br>
    <p>

      The startup had dismissed Altman on Friday citing a "breakdown of communications," according to an internal memo.
      Reports emerged that OpenAI's board approached Anthropic's CEO about replacing Altman and potentially merging the
      two AI startups, but the offer was declined.</p><br>
    <p>

      Employees, in a letter calling for the board's resignation, demanded the appointment of new independent directors
      and criticized the board's capability to oversee OpenAI.</p><br>
    <p>

      Microsoft's support for Altman's return to OpenAI had seemed likely, but the events over the weekend have brought
      unforeseen changes. Altman is set to become CEO of a new research group inside Microsoft, along with other
      departing OpenAI colleagues who quit following his ouster.</p><br>
    <p>

      The developments at OpenAI underscore long-standing internal divides among employees, revolving around differing
      ideals in AI development.</p><br>
    <p>

      Analysts suggest that the recent events mark a detonation of underlying tensions, with the world's largest
      corporations now potentially steering the future of AI development without clear oversight and commitment to
      safety.</p><br>
    <p>

      Microsoft, having heavily invested in OpenAI, released AI copilots to business customers based on OpenAI's
      technology. The collaboration had been seen as crucial for the development of superintelligent machines.</p><br>
    <p>

      SemiAnalysis, a research and consulting firm, noted that any attempt by OpenAI's nonprofit board to slow down AI
      development for safety concerns had backfired, putting major corporations in the driver's seat.</p><br>
    <p>

      Microsoft's role in shaping the future of OpenAI and the resolution of internal conflicts will undoubtedly
      influence the trajectory of AI development globally.</p><br>
